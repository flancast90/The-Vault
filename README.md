> A 'Vault' to conatin and password-protect your most precious files. Uses AES encrytion and data URL's to give a sort of 'cloud' feel. All without a server, and totally secure!

Welcome to The Vault, a simple self-updating file hosting service! The entire project is based upon services such as Google Drive and Dropbox, but with a more 'hacky' feel and without a server. The project, by <a href="www.github.com/flancast90">flancast90</a>, and powered by CryptoJS AES encrytion, is made to be utilitarian and open source. Changes are welcomed via pull requests!
